/**
 * Exercise 1: Read Orocos Component Builder's Manual, Chap 2 sect 3 and 3.1
 *
 * First, compile and run this application and try to start the component
 * from the TaskBrowser console. How often is updateHook() executed ? Why ?
 *
 * Tip: In order to find out which functions this component has, type 'ls', and
 * for detailed information, type 'help this' (i.e. print the interface of the 'this'
 * task object).
 *
 * Next, Set the period of the component in configureHook to 0.5 seconds and
 * make start() succeed when the period of the component indeed equals 0.5 seconds.
 *
 * Next, add functions which use the log(Info) construct to display
 * a notice when the configureHook(), startHook(), stopHook() and cleanupHook()
 * are executed. (Note: not all these functions return a bool!)
 *
 * Recompile and restart this application and try to configure, start, stop
 * and cleanup the component.
 *
 * Optional: Let the Hello component be created in the 'PreOperational' mode.
 * What effect does this have on the acceptance of the start() method ?
 * Optional: Replace the Activity with a SlaveActivity. What are
 * the effects of trigger and update in comparison with the other activity types ?
